# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to write a program for someone looking to take a vacation that wants to filter their travel criteria based on weather. I refactored the code from the module to include a brief weather description for each city. Additionally, I created a travel itinerary that included a round trip travel through 4 different cities and showed the route they would take with hotels to stay at. All stops included their ideal weather conditions.
